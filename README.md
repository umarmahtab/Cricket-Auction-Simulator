Cricket Auction Simulator üèè
Welcome to the Cricket Auction Simulator! This is a dynamic, single-page web application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that brings the thrill of a live cricket player auction right to your browser.

Manage your own franchise, strategize your bids, and build a championship-winning team from a pool of world-class cricketers.

‚ú® Features
This simulator is packed with features to provide a realistic and engaging auction experience:

Team Customization: Name your own three franchises to compete for glory.

Real-time Bidding: Engage in fast-paced bidding wars with a 60-second timer for each player.

Player Retention: Strategically retain up to 5 key players from your original roster before the main auction begins.

Right to Match (RTM) Cards: Use your one-time RTM card to steal a former player back from a rival's winning bid.

Live Stats Dashboard: Keep an eye on key auction metrics with a real-time dashboard showing:

Most Expensive Player

Team with the Highest Purse

Immersive Experience: Sound effects for bids, sold players, and timers make the auction feel alive.
